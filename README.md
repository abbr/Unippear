SiteLayoutService
=================

Enforce consistent look-and-feel to multiple enterprise websites through centralized layout manager service.

## Background
A large organization often owns many web sites, such as vanity sites, sites of its  subsidiaries etc, in addition to home portal. Maintaining a consistent look-and-feel for branding purpose is not only desirable, but sometimes mandatory. In early days when most websites were built with static HTML files, consistency is achieved through sharing a set of template files by copying. This solution hardly works nowadays because different sites are usually built with different technologies employing different template engines.
