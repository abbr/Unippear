                <h2 class="entry-title">Welcome!</h2> Does this page look like an OOTB WordPress installation? If you think so, then my goal is partially achieved! Actually, the page is generated from a static HTML file of which source is available <a href="https://github.com/abbr/Unippear/blob/master/public/assets/test.html" target="_blank">here</a>. Looking at the source, you'll find it only contains this "Welcome" paragragh. Then where does the header (all stuff before this paragragh) and footer (all stuff afterwards) come from? The answer is this JS block:
                <pre>&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;/index.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;
    unippear({
        &quot;headerContainer&quot;: &quot;#wrapper&quot;,
        &quot;footerContainer&quot;: &quot;#wrapper&quot;
    });
&lt;/script&gt;
</pre> Factoring header, footer and associated assets (CSS, JS, img etc) out of a document isn't new. Almost all template engines are capable of. But those template engines are platform specific and thus only work for one website. Unipear turns the layout into a service to make it shareable among multiple websites. If this is of interest to you, return to <a href="https://github.com/abbr/Unippear#live-demo">Unippear</a> and keep reading.
